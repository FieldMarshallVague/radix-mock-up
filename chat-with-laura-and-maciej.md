# Chat with Laura and Maciej  (Machay? Ma-jay?  'J' as in the 'Xi' in 'Xiaomi')

- I've joined all the obvious media channels.
- I've watched several tech vids (Dan)
- I've joined the Discord and Telegram channels, but it's not particularly useful unless you're following a thread.

  - classic threads are easier, but seem to be less popular nowadays.

## questions

What is your definition of Brand success?
  Can you give you me a few examples of real-world events that would signify achieving this?

Do you deal with the technical documentation and tutorial sites/pages?

Are there plans for having a great DX?
  Is developer mind-share seen as an integral part of brand success?

E.g tools, videos, examples, tutorial sites?

- Are you going to be building a presence on the 'web 3.0' technologies, like steemit, scuttlebutt etc.?

  - Building with the emerging techs should increase mind-share among the progressive-tech community.
  - hard to know which ones to invest time in.
