# Chat with Laura and Maciej  

Machay? Ma-jay?  'J' as in the 'Xi' in 'Xiaomi'

- I've joined all the obvious media channels.
- I've watched several tech vids (Dan)
- I've joined the Discord and Telegram channels, but it's not particularly useful unless you're following a thread.

  - classic threads are easier, but seem to be less popular nowadays.

## questions

I'm curious as to what made Laura and Maciej join Radix (and Crypto in general)
  
- They seem to be new and unique problems to solve.
- How do you go about deciding what will work?

How would you describe the brand identity?

- What approaches do you intend to use to differentiate Radix from traditional banking systems?

What is your definition of Brand success?

- Can you give you me a few examples of real-world events that would signify achieving this?

Would we be dealing with the technical documentation and tutorial sites/pages?

### I had problems on-boarding with a bitcoin clone

Gatekeepers, lack of documentation, too many broken repos, no commenting or external guides, 
Is developer mind-share seen as an integral part of brand success?

- and if so, are there plans for having a great Developer experience (DX)?
- E.g tools, videos, examples, tutorial sites?

Are you going to be building a presence on the 'web 3.0' technologies, like steemit, scuttlebutt etc.?

- Building with the emerging techs should increase mind-share among the progressive-tech community.
- hard to know which ones to invest time in.
