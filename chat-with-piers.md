## Possible questions

### Why do you want to work with Radix?

- long interest in disruptive technology replacing existing structures.

  - loved the idea of replacing lawyers, banks, agents etc. with code.

    - removal of greedy middle-men.  
    - DLTs bring to mind the idea of Heinlein's 'witnesses' from SIASL.  In that they provide an immutable, agreed truth and it really resonated as solving a huge problem in trust.  Now it seems like we have something similar with this technology.

  - digital ownership is a great idea.

- bitcoin-based blockchain seemed ideal, but obvious issues with scaling (speed of confirmation, power consumption)
- when I read about Radix, I followed the breadcrumbs to Lamport's logical clocks

  - I was impressed by the simplicity and the reduction in need for peer-review/confirmation.
  - I thought, "If this is secure, then it's going to be massive!"

    - I couldn't see any obvious limitations, like I did with bitcoin-based implementations (e.g. latency, on-chain storage).
    - I'd looked at blockchain-based gaming and the latency is very constraining:

      - multi-player interaction
      - transactions

- Seems like a well-thought out holistically-consistent replacement for existing DLTs.  Rather than a 'me too!' refactoring or a simple fork.

### What are your favourite achievements?

- Working at FE for 11 years, starting with 19 people and leaving when it was ~300 and with a huge market share.

  - Played an important role between the tech and sales teams.  
  - Could speak both 'languages' and worked hard to improve the delivery speed, accuracy and attractiveness of solutions.
  - Really enjoyed being part of something that grew into a major player.

  - I left because it became too familiar, constant unpaid overtime (2 hours a day), non-standard practices, technical debt and affecting change was very difficult due to internal politics.

    - I wanted to regain the hunger for knowledge and self-improvement I had when I started.

- I wrote a paper on CKM tailored to all relevant parties to show how we could improve internal comms and issue management.
  - Mostly it was motivated by what I saw as a HUGE mistake being made in how we were about to handle KM (Uni-directional, multi-step, no-onto/schema/tags, KM via SupportWorks).
  - The paper stopped the roll-out (and was applauded by directors) but it wasn't actioned until 2 years after I left.

    - Collaborative knowledge management.  An attempt to make the company more productive, more inspiring and more efficient.

- Creating a DHTML charting tool for FE that went on to sell dozens of copies to most of the major international banks.

  - Same goes for most price table/portfolio tools I worked on.  I'd spend extra time making them feel slick and nice to use. Sales people bought me lots of beer. :D

- Creating an online version of the FT (http://www.fundlistings.com/) - it's sooo bad now, but it was my first real project with DHTML.

  - It replaced an incumbent, removed the need for paper waste, was more up-to-date (15 minutes, IIRC).

- Vianet prototypes

  - iDraught app.  Created a hybrid app (Ionic) as a PoC for their estate owners to get insight into collected data, with D3.js.

    - was first published app in all stores (G, A and MS).
  - Calibrator app.  real-time IoT integration for on-site sensor calibration.

    - First enterprise-level IoT project.
    - Big success for their business.
  - Smart Machines.  Dashboard for estate asset management.
  
    - Google maps overlay, vending machine data viewer with dynamic SVG icons and zoom-clustering.
    - Was most highly-valued part of dashboard and clients spoke well of it (was regarded as the only successful module).

### Where do I want to go with this?

- I want to help the project become a success in many areas:  financial, legal, gaming, digital retail/ownership.
- I want to be proud of my work.
- I want to create things that improve QoL in the areas they affect.  

  - Reduction of overheads/middle-men and wastage.
  - Improved speed, UX and trust.
- I want to be flexible in my location and earn well.
- I want to keep my passion for solution development and using new technology to solve problems.


###  Questions for Piers

- Is the development of quantum-computing a mitigating factor in the future success of Radix?

  - i.e.  are plans in place to protect against it?

- I see a lot of alpha/beta-tags but Radix seems busy building use-cases for the DLT already.

  - How is it going?
  - What seems the most promising so far?
  - How is the financial transaction-integration going?  Where do you plan to put it at street-level?

- Can you clarify how people are incentivised to host nodes?

  - I understand the price will be kept steady via supply management.
